Attacker->>Botnet; Command/Instructions to initiate the DDoS attack
BotNet->>WebServer; DDoS Attack Commences
WebServer->>Firewall; High traffic or packet density detected
Firewall->>WebServer; Analysis of the high traffic
Firewall->>Attacker; IP Blocking

Explanation: The attacker is the person or system that is sending the DDoS attack through commands in the botnet
The botnet then receives commands from the attacker and launches the DDoS attack towards the target
After that the WebServer will experience a surge of traffic this will trigger the defensive mechanisms within the webserver and firewall
The firewall will detect the high traffic and will analyze the traffic to identify if there are any malicious patterns
After the firewall analyzes the traffic the firewall will block the IP address of the attacker which will mitigate the DDoS attack.
